# 🔒 Phishing URL Detector using Machine Learning

This project is a simple yet effective **Phishing URL Detection Web App** built using **Python**, **Flask**, and **Scikit-learn**. It uses machine learning to detect if a given URL is **legitimate** or **phishing** based on patterns, keywords, and URL structure.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Predict if a URL is Phishing or Legitimate
- 🔍 Uses a trained ML model (RandomForestClassifier)
- 🧠 Feature extraction based on URL structure
- 🌐 Web interface using Flask

## 🧠 Model Used

**RandomForestClassifier** from `scikit-learn` is used to classify URLs. Features are extracted using basic URL characteristics like:
- Use of IP address
- Use of `https`
- Presence of `@`
- Length of URL
- URL shortening services (e.g., `bit.ly`, `tinyurl`)
- And more...
